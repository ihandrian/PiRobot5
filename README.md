## Installation

### Quick Setup (Recommended)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ihandrian/PiRobot5.git
   cd PiRobot5
   ```

2. Run the setup script (as root):
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup_pi.sh
   sudo ./setup_pi.sh
   ```

3. Reboot your Raspberry Pi:
   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

4. After reboot, activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   source PiRobot/bin/activate
   ```

5. Verify the installation:
   ```bash
   python test_installation.py
   ```

### Manual Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ihandrian/PiRobot5.git
   cd PiRobot5
   ```

2. Create and activate virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv PiRobot
   source PiRobot/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r training/requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure the system:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p config
   # Edit config/data_collector.yaml as needed
   ```

## Usage

### Data Collection
1. Start the data collector:
   ```bash
   python src/core/data_collector.py
   ```

2. Use the interface to:
   - Start/stop recording
   - Save frames manually
   - View real-time sensor data
   - Monitor system status

### Training
1. Collect training data using the data collector
2. Upload data to Google Colab
3. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python training/mapping/train.py
   ```

### Room Mapping
1. Deploy the trained model
2. Start the room mapper:
   ```bash
   python training/mapping/room_mapper.py
   ```

## Security Considerations

### üîí Security Best Practices

- **Network Security**: The robot runs web services on ports 5002 and 5003. Ensure your network is secure.
- **Access Control**: Change default passwords and use strong authentication.
- **Firewall**: Configure firewall rules to restrict access to robot services.
- **Updates**: Regularly update the system and dependencies for security patches.
- **Sensitive Data**: Never commit passwords, API keys, or personal data to the repository.

### üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

- **Emergency Stop**: Hardware emergency stop button for immediate robot shutdown
- **Collision Detection**: Ultrasonic sensors prevent collisions
- **Temperature Monitoring**: Automatic shutdown on overheating
- **Battery Monitoring**: Low battery protection and warnings

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Notes
