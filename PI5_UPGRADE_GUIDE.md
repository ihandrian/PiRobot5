- Improved power management settings

## Performance Improvements

### Expected Performance Gains
- **CPU Performance**: 2-3x faster processing
- **Memory**: 4-8x more RAM available
- **Camera**: Support for higher resolutions and dual cameras
- **Real-time**: Better real-time performance for motor control
- **AI/ML**: Faster inference with optimized PyTorch

### Monitoring Performance
```bash
# Monitor system performance
htop

# Check temperature
cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp

# Monitor GPU usage
vcgencmd measure_temp
vcgencmd get_mem gpu
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. High Temperature
**Symptoms**: Robot shuts down or throttles performance
**Solution**: 
- Install active cooling (Pi 5 active cooler recommended)
- Check thermal paste application
- Monitor with: `watch -n 1 cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp`

#### 2. Power Issues
**Symptoms**: Random shutdowns or instability
**Solution**:
- Use official Pi 5 power supply (5V 4A)
- Check power supply quality
- Monitor voltage: `vcgencmd measure_volts`

#### 3. Camera Not Detected
**Symptoms**: No camera feed or detection errors
**Solution**:
- Check camera connections
- Enable camera in raspi-config
- Test with: `libcamera-hello --list-cameras`

#### 4. GPIO Issues
**Symptoms**: Motor control or sensor errors
**Solution**:
- Check GPIO pin assignments
- Verify hardware connections
- Test GPIO: `python -c "import RPi.GPIO as GPIO; GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)"`

### Performance Optimization

#### 1. CPU Optimization
```bash
# Set CPU governor to performance
echo performance | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor

# Check current frequency
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq
```

#### 2. Memory Optimization
```bash
# Check memory usage
free -h

# Optimize swap usage
sudo swapon --show
```

#### 3. I/O Optimization
```bash
# Set I/O scheduler
echo deadline | sudo tee /sys/block/mmcblk0/queue/scheduler

# Check I/O performance
sudo iotop
```

## Advanced Features

### Dual Camera Support
Pi 5 supports dual cameras for enhanced vision:
```python
# Primary camera
camera_primary = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

# Secondary camera  
camera_secondary = cv2.VideoCapture(1)
```

### M.2 SSD Support
Pi 5 supports M.2 NVMe SSDs for faster storage:
```bash
# Check if M.2 is detected
lsblk

# Mount M.2 SSD
sudo mkdir /mnt/nvme
sudo mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt/nvme
```

### Enhanced Networking
Pi 5 has improved networking capabilities:
- 5GHz Wi-Fi support
